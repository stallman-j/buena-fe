# Buena Fé

This is a GitHub repository holding public collaboration documentation and code for a collaborative project regarding transparency in Ecuador, institutional capacity, and citizen involvement between the [Inter-American Development Bank Andean Group](https://www.iadb.org/en/who-we-are/how-we-are-organized/departments-offices-and-sectors/country-department-andean-group) (liaised by Osmel Enrique Manzano and Daniela Sofia Valdivia Llerena), [FARO](https://grupofaro.org/areas-de-trabajo/extrayendo-transparencia/) and Yale University (with [Jillian Stallman, PhD Candidate in Economics as the liaison](https://stallman-j.github.io/)). 

The title of this repository borrows from the "ideal thought experiment": to determine the effect of a particular intervention, one would ideally implement the initiative in randomly selected geographical units. In practice, this is rarely feasible in such a blunt manner.

Nothing stops us from selecting our project name in this manner, however! 

Buena Fé was chosen among Ecuador's cantons at random. You can see a vignette of the R code which implemented this randomization [here](https://stallman-j.github.io/ekonomR/vignettes/basic-mapping/).
