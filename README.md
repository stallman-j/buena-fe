# Buena Fé

This is a GitHub repository holding public collaboration documentation and code for a collaborative project regarding transparency in Ecuador, institutional capacity, and citizen involvement between the [Inter-American Development Bank Andean Group](https://www.iadb.org/en/who-we-are/how-we-are-organized/departments-offices-and-sectors/country-department-andean-group) (liaised by Osmel Manzano and Daniela Valdivia), [FARO](https://grupofaro.org/areas-de-trabajo/extrayendo-transparencia/) and Yale University (with [Jillian Stallman, PhD Candidate in Economics as the liaison](https://stallman-j.github.io/)). 

The title of this repo borrows from an ideal vision of the project: to determine the effect of a particular initiative, one would ideally select geographical units at random. In practice, this is rarely feasible in such a simple way. However, we were able to achieve this in the naming process. Buena Fé was chosen among Ecuador's cantons at random.
