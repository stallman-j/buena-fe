This folder contains pictures that can be added to presentations to give the audience an idea of parts of the scenery in Ecuador.

The pictures in "old-pics_2015" were taken by J Stallman in May-June of 2015 in and around Chugchilán, Baños, Riobamba, Cuenca, generally around the province of Tungurahua, and likely some unlabeled images around Otovalo. Pictures weren't taken with any particular goal in mind, but likely capture things notable to an external observer not familiar with Central or South America. 

They can be used freely in presentations as long as there's some form of attribution so that the audience knows they're not Google search images. Citing (Stallman, taken c. 2015-05) in a caption would suffice.
